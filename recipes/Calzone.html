    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 .25 ounce package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 and a half cups all-purpose flour; extra flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and a half cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Half a cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Half cup diced pepperoni</li>
        <li>Half cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl;
            let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil,
            sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually
            stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.
        </li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until elastic. about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl; lay dough in the bowl
            and flip to coat with oil. Cover and let rise until almost doubles in size, about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Make Filling: Meanwhile, combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms
            , and basil leaves in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate to chill.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough: divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out on a lightly floured
            surface into 1/8-inch-thick circles. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese and meat filling;
            fold dough over filling to make a semicircle. Press edges down with the tines of a fork to seal. 
            Brush the top of each calzone with beaten egg and place on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
